## robotDescriptiongenrate manual instruction

**let robotName = loadModel(modelPath:string)**  

modelPath: the path file of coppeliasim model  
robotName: return the name of robot model  
We can use this function load coppeliasim model to coppeliasim scene by code. Or we can directly import the model manually in coppeliasim interface  

**robotInfogeneration(robotName:string, rootFolderPath:string)**  

This function will get all necessary information from the virtual robot. These infomation are saved in rootFolderPath and will be used to generate robotic Thing description  

**generateTD(robotName:string, rootFolderPath:string)**  

Based on information of robot, it could automatically generate the robotic Thing description. For some robot with special structure, we need to manually write script to generate infomation instead of the second function. Based on these information we can directly use this function to generate the Thing Description
